# Capstone Project: Effect of Rent Control on House Prices in Ireland

# **1.Overview**
Since early 2012 both housing and rental prices have been steadily rising year on year. Rental prices are now at a level that is 1.5 times what it was nationwide in 2007 [1]. Implemented in 2016, the rental cap (Rent Predictability Measure) has attempted to quell the steep rise in rental prices. The primary goal of this project is to see if and to what extent these regulations have affected housing prices in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs).
